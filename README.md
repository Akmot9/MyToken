# Akmot Coin
This is a smart contract implementation of an ERC-20 token named "Akmot Coin" with the symbol "Akmot". The code is written in the Solidity programming language, version 0.7.0 to 0.9.0, and uses the OpenZeppelin library for the ERC-20 token standard.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you deploy and interact with the Akmot Coin contract.

### Prerequisites
A blockchain network with support for smart contracts, such as Ethereum.
A development environment with a Solidity compiler and a way to deploy contracts, such as Remix.
A wallet or tool to interact with the contract, such as MetaMask.
###Â Deployment
Compile the contract code using a Solidity compiler.
Deploy the compiled contract code to the blockchain network.
Interact with the deployed contract using a wallet or tool.
### Usage
The constructor of the contract mints 1,000,000 tokens and assigns them to the message sender (usually the contract deployer).

After deployment, the contract can be used for various token-related operations, such as transferring tokens, checking the balance of an address, and more.
